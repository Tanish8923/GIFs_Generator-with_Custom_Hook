# ✨ Crafting Dynamic GIFs with React Custom Hooks: Presenting GIFs_Generator-with_Custom_Hook! ✨

Delighted to share my latest React project — **GIFs_Generator-with_Custom_Hook**, where I explored **custom hooks** and **Axios** to streamline functionality and enhance code reusability. 🚀

## 🛠️ Key Highlights of the Project:

### 🔹 Random GIFs Generation:
- Developed the **Random** component to display a random GIF along with a **Generate** button.
- On each button click, a new GIF is fetched and displayed seamlessly.

### 🔹 Search-Based GIFs Generation:
- Built the **Tag** component, featuring a text field and a **Generate** button.
- Users can type any keyword in the text field to fetch and display a GIF matching the query.

### 🔹 Spinner Integration:
- Created a **Spinner** component to provide visual feedback during API calls.
- The spinner appears while GIF data is being fetched and is replaced by the GIF once loaded, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 🔹 Custom Hook Implementation:
- Developed the **useGif** custom hook to encapsulate shared logic between **Random.js** and **Tag.js**.
- This custom hook centralizes API calls, state management, and loading logic, resulting in clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

### 🔹 Axios for API Calls:
- Utilized **Axios** for handling API requests efficiently.
- **Key benefits of Axios explored:**
  - Simplified request configuration.
  - Built-in support for JSON transformations.
  - Streamlined error handling for improved debugging.

### 🔹 Tailwind CSS for Styling:
- Leveraged **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and consistent user interface, enhancing the visual appeal.

## 🔍 Key Observations:
- **Custom hooks** significantly enhance code reusability and maintainability by abstracting shared logic.
- **Axios** simplifies API integrations with its powerful features, making it a go-to choice for robust client-side HTTP requests.
- Managing UI states like **loading spinners** adds polish to user interactions.

Building **GIFs_Generator-with_Custom_Hook** was an exciting dive into advanced React concepts and practical API handling. 🚀
